# density-nanofluid-Ansys-Fluent-UDF
This UDF defines a function that calculates the density of a nanofluid at a given cell and thread in Fluent. A nanofluid is a fluid that contains suspended nanoparticles that can enhance its thermal and electrical properties. The UDF uses the following parameters and variables:

•  nanofluid_density: the name of the user-defined function that takes two arguments: c and t.

•  c: a variable that represents a cell in the cell loop.

•  t: a pointer to the thread structure of the cell zone where the density is calculated.

•  T: a scalar that represents the temperature of the fluid zone. It has units of K.

•  rho_base: a scalar that represents the density of the base fluid. It has units of kg/m^3.

•  rho_nano: a scalar that represents the density of the nanoparticle. It has units of kg/m^3. It has a constant value of 3970 kg/m^3.

•  vol_frac: a scalar that represents the volume fraction of the nanoparticle in the nanofluid. It is a dimensionless parameter that represents

the ratio of
the nanoparticle volume to
the fluid volume in a given region. It has a constant value of 0.01.
•  rho_nanofluid: a scalar that represents the density of the nanofluid. It has units of kg/m^3.

•  C_T: a macro that returns the temperature of the cell c and thread t.

•  RHO_BASE(T): a macro that defines a polynomial expression for the density of the base fluid as a function of temperature.

The UDF performs the following steps:


It defines some constants and variables for the simulation.
It calculates the temperature of the fluid zone using C_T and stores it in T.
It calculates the density of the base fluid using a piecewise polynomial expression based on T and stores it in rho_base. The expression is given by $$\rho_{base} = \begin{cases} 1072.43701 & \text{if } T < 285.15 \ 1.4386e3 - 1.8711 T + 2.737e-3 T^2 - 2.3793e-6 T^3 & \text{if } 285.15 \leq T \leq 698.15 \ 656.6956 & \text{if } T > 698.15 \end{cases}$$ where $T$ is
the temperature
of
the base fluid.
It calculates the density of the nanofluid using a weighted average formula based on vol_frac, rho_base, and rho_nano and stores it in rho_nanofluid. The formula is given by $$\rho_{nanofluid} = (1 - \phi) \rho_{base} + \phi \rho_{nano}$$ where $\phi$ is
the volume fraction
of
the nanoparticle, $\rho_{base}$ and $\rho_{nano}$ are
the densities
of
the base fluid and
the nanoparticle, respectively.
It returns rho_nanofluid as
the output
of
the function.

The UDF can be used to model fluid flow problems with nanofluids, such as solar collectors, heat exchangers, or cooling systems.
